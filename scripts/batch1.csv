celle de Morphée Tout ira mieux demain, dans les deux sens  Le monde est si vaste, j'veux juste laisser une trace  Je sais pas combien d'années je vais vivre mais j'veux les vivre avec toi  Ma boite aux lettres est pleine Mais la seule lettre qui m'intéresse c'est la douzième  Chui tatoué que de l'intérieur  Love you more, oxymore  Le ciel est dégagé, on voit tes jolis yeux  On fusionne mille fois par jour  J'ai la même scène gravée sur les paupières  On peut mourir sans disparaître  J'suis plus habitué à être regardé  J'suis sur ma propre barque, au milieu d'la mer blanche, j'l'aboie comme Cerbère Le phare comme seule lumière, mes mains cachent les murmures des réverbères  Sur le même chemin 7 sur 7, pour en rajouter un troisième  J'me pose une nouvelle question chaque seconde,

négativité en positivité  J'écris dans ma chambre pour chanter sur la scène  J'ai pas peur de perdre, j'ai peur de m'perdre  J'étais là sans être là comme Gaster J'quitte les figurants pour entrer dans les acteurs  Tu verras jamais mon vrai visage comme Fatalis et Orko J'vois beaucoup d'latence quand j'analyse leur co  On l'fait avec de l'autotune  Les aiguilles tournent, hier c'était l'hiver
